# employee-tracker
Work with a database that will allow you to look at your employees
## Description

- You can search for employee, departments, and etc.
- Hopefully, in the future you will be able to add and update employees, but as of this moment you aren't able too
- It was a difficult project to code there are still problems that are happening but hopefully I will be able to fix them in the future.
